ABSTRACT:

To provide a succinct overview of our innovative solution aimed at enhancing maternal care through the development of a wearable wristband tailored for pregnant women. The wristband, equipped with advanced sensors and connectivity features, serves as a comprehensive monitoring and support tool throughout pregnancy. This research explores the design, functionality, and potential impact of the wristband on maternal well-being. We discuss the benefits of real-time health data tracking, remote monitoring capabilities, and the potential to improve prenatal care accessibility. Additionally, the abstract highlights our findings related to user acceptance and the implications for the future of maternal care. This wearable technology offers a promising avenue for optimizing maternal health, reducing complications, and enhancing the overall pregnancy experience.

OBJECTIVES:
* To enable the continuous monitoring of health parameters  in maternity care.
* To evaluate the feasibility of using a smart wristband to collect continuous activity, sleep and heart rate data from the beginning of the second trimester until one month postpartum.
* To make SOS calls to the nearby hospitals and to a homie in the  emergency situation.
* To schedule the tablets intake timings
* To maintain nutrition balance.

OUTCOMES:
*	Improved Monitoring: The wristband may allow pregnant women to monitor vital signs like heart rate, fetal movement, and contractions, leading to better awareness of their health and the baby's well-being. 
*	Enhanced Convenience: If the project succeeds, pregnant women may experience increased comfort and convenience in tracking their pregnancy-related data 
*	Cost Savings: If the wearable reduces the need for hospital visits or interventions, it could lead to cost savings for both patients and healthcare provider 
*	Medication scheduling: the pregnant ladies could access the feature of scheduled intimations for medicine intake remainders.
*	Fearless childbirth: pregnant women can make a SOS call in the occurrence of labor pain or any other emergency situation to nearby hospitals and to the  homies.
